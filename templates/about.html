        <p><strong>Software Background Information</strong></p>
        <p>As a software developer, I have gained experience in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools to create functional and efficient solutions for different projects. One of the areas I have focused on is web development, specifically building REST APIs and blogs using Python. With Python, I have also worked with SQLite to manage databases, as well as Pandas and NumPy to manipulate and analyze data.</p>
        <p>For data analysis, I have used Pandas for dataframe inspection, data cleaning, sorting, arithmetical operations, pivot tables, and time series smoothing. I have also utilized Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create different types of charts, from line charts to scatterplots, bubble charts, and various statistical charts.</p>
        <p>To streamline my work and keep track of my progress, I use Jupyter Notebook and HTML Markdown. Additionally, I have experience in working with relational database schemas, descriptive statistics, regression analysis, and residuals analysis using tools like Scikit-Learn</p>
        <p>In summary, I have developed skills and knowledge in the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Building REST APIs and blogs with Python</li>
          <li>Working with databases using SQLite</li>
          <li>Data analysis with Pandas and NumPy</li>
          <li>Data visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly</li>
          <li>Jupyter Notebook and HTML Markdown</li>
          <li>Regression analysis with Scikit-Learn</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am passionate about software development and continuously learning new skills and technologies to improve my craft.</p>
